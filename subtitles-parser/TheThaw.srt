1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:19,910
The Thaw

2
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:32,775
My name is David Kruipen.

3
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:36,615
"What is sacrifice?

4
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:40,640
What does it mean
to make a real difference?

5
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:45,566
Throughout my life and career,
I have straddled two worlds.

6
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,520
Increasingly I have become...

7
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,258
respected.

8
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,518
Increasingly my books
and articles...

9
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,821
are published and read.

10
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,428
Increasingly I have been
embraced by policymakers...

11
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,861
and referenced by bureaucrats...

12
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,686
but today I realized...

13
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,815
that I have...

14
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,899
misguided myself.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,115
Today I rediscovered...

16
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:16,747
what I knew
when I was young".

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,499
- Is that one on her forehead?
- I can't look.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,584
Jesus Christ!

19
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:29,366
I know.

20
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,365
You said it was a tick.

21
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:33,884
- Um, I don't know if it was a tick.
- It's not a tick.

22
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,796
- It was a bug.
- It hurts.

23
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,230
I know, sweetheart,
but I need you to stay still.

24
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,532
Okay, it's just about there.
Hold on, hold on.

25
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,531
Hold on.
Okay okay.

26
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:46,138
Okay, there, Doug,
do you see that?

27
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,659
- Jesus.
- What?

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,049
- See those hairs?
- Get the tweezers, the tweezers.

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,439
I want you to grab it. Honey,
keep your head still, please.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,308
- Get back in so I can see it.
- What?

31
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:56,132
Get... Just...

32
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,610
Shit.

33
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,346
What do I do?
What do I do?

34
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:02,346
We have to do something
about the population.

35
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,909
- And what is wrong with the population?
- We have too many people.

36
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,603
There's way too many people
using way too much stuff.

37
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:09,472
That's why we have
global warming.

38
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:11,992
They will tell you
that we are on the verge...

39
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:15,469
of imminent destruction.
The carbon dioxide in the air...

40
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,336
is gonna turn our atmosphere
into a microwave...

41
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,161
and we're all gonna burn and die.

42
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:23,317
What a load of crap.

43
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:26,678
I don't care what they say.

44
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,807
It's not a glacial meltdown
or anything like that.

45
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:30,849
For decades
we've been warned.

46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,978
Global warming is definitely real
and it's potentially catastrophic.

47
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,934
I believe it's prophecy
being fulfilled...

48
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:38,584
hard times that's spoken
about in the Bible.

49
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,888
Global warming is
becoming a religion...

50
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,104
for some of these...
for some of these loonies.

51
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:46,520
Of course there's global warming
and of course it's man-made.

52
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,491
It's a hoax.

53
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,098
The melting Arctic will
reveal a frightening truth.

54
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,080
I don't think that people are
going to do enough in time.

55
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,659
We're on the brink of Armageddon.
Most of us will die.

56
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,049
The few of us who survive will be...

57
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,135
living in a world like Somalia.

58
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:06,568
And what can we do about it?

59
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,697
We make small sacrifices,
but the real ones that really matter...

60
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:12,129
- The world will change, I don't think.
- Ever.

61
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,346
What does it mean to make
a real difference?

62
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,951
radical environmentalists and
clearly a legitimate terrorist threat.

63
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:21,558
When non-violent
methods fail to...

64
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,774
change people's minds
quickly enough...

65
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,078
well, we have to consider
other options.

66
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,641
- The time is now.
- We have a breaking story.

67
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,943
It's spreading quickly
and hospitals cannot keep up.

68
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:35,159
Thousands are violently ill,
hundreds dead.

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,462
There is complete chaos
in the streets.

70
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:41,417
400 people have died.
At least 10,000 are infected.

71
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:44,849
State troopers and the National Guard
were ordered to seal off all borders...

72
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,439
as people
are trying to flee.

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,045
When nature is the terrorist...

74
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,490
We're gonna... we're gonna die.

75
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,315
It's too late to do anything.

76
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,689
Die, I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die!

77
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:09,486
I'm gonna... Help me!

78
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:13,266
One of the horrors...

79
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:16,308
The worst bioterrorism
we've ever known.

80
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,898
Oh my God!

81
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,418
I'm dead!

82
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,980
David!

83
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,147
A couple hundred pounds
underweight.

84
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:21,232
He must have traveled far.

85
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,561
The teeth... only two years old.

86
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:28,228
He probably tried to swim...

87
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,574
off island, had to come back.

88
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,252
Not enough ice.

89
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,350
What's he saying?

90
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,071
He's saying get
the fuck over here.

91
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:48,242
What did you find, man?

92
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:53,474
What is it?

93
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,933
Manalu.

94
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,856
The pine beetle is
just one example...

95
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:11,811
of the profound impact
global warming is having on the planet.

96
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:15,503
The truth is our way of life
is leaving the door open...

97
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,503
to an infinite number
of threats...

98
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,066
equally as pernicious
as the tiny pine beetle.

99
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:24,194
We're not going to see an end
to this sort of horror...

100
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,541
unless sacrifices are made.

101
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,365
And that's all for now.

102
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,494
Now as you know, a few
of you will have the honor...

103
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,884
of joining the renown
Dr. Kruipen and his team...

104
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,360
studying the impact
of global warming...

105
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,012
on polar bears.

106
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,791
Atom Galen...

107
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,355
Federico Fulce...

108
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:47,381
and Ling Chen.

109
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,219
- Yes, Atom?
- I thought four students were going.

110
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,112
So did I. Unfortunately
that is no longer the case.

111
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:06,603
Jesus Christ!

112
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,558
You know, we probably would
have been there by now...

113
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,931
if you guys didn't have to, like,
put on four different bathing suits.

114
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:18,379
I asked you
to please not call me.

115
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,594
Evelyn, don't hang up.
It's important.

116
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:24,853
We discovered something.
I want you to come up.

117
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:27,026
I told you I'm not ready
to see you.

118
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:29,024
Can we please
just leave it at that?

119
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,328
Ev, I just...

120
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,440
I want you to understand.

121
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,455
You want me to understand?

122
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:39,089
Dad, you couldn't even
make it to her funeral.

123
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,798
Evelyn, this is important.

124
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,345
It's important to our cause.

125
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:49,274
Look, Dad, it's not my cause.

126
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,576
It's your cause.
You're the one who chose...

127
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:55,009
Okay, so apparently people just get out
of vehicles when they're moving.

128
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,833
Everybody knows about global warming.
Congratulations.

129
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:00,179
It just really too bad
nobody really gives a shit.

130
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,264
Ev, I'll...

131
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:06,637
give you all
of your mother's money.

132
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:11,998
- No more monthly payments?
- That's right.

133
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:14,953
There are some students
coming up from Dawson...

134
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,544
I'll save you a seat.

135
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:21,020
Hey, Evy, get in the car!

136
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,077
Uh, I'll... I don't know.
I'll think about it.

137
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:28,293
- Get in the car!
- Dad, look, I have to go.

138
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:31,378
I'll think about it.
Could you hold on a minute?

139
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,925
- We're moving.
- Calm down.

140
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,938
How can I communicate
with the world...

141
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:41,154
when I can't even communicate
with my own daughter?

142
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,006
She's just angry right now.
She'll come around.

143
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:51,261
What?

144
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,980
Eight hours from bottle
to throttle, buddy.

145
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:31,298
Are you good?

146
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,166
Yeah, I'm good.

147
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,730
Someone named Ling called.

148
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:38,381
- Said she was running late.
- Thanks.

149
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:41,146
Sounded cute.

150
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:49,243
Hello?

151
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,286
Bart, I need your help.

152
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:54,067
Dr. Kruipen?

153
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,587
I can't reach Evy.
She can't come up.

154
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:59,195
Why?
Is everything okay?

155
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,107
Yes, everything's fine.

156
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,697
Just make sure she
doesn't come up.

157
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:09,057
- Okay.
- I'll send her paperwork back with you.

158
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:11,230
Sure.

159
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,473
Listen...

160
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,366
Did you reach Bart?

161
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,945
David, did you
tell them not to come?

162
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,814
To call for help?

163
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:56,491
- Yes, I did.
- Thank God.

164
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,286
Nuti is...

165
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,573
he's much worse.

166
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,483
And I'm...

167
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:12,612
I'm not much better.

168
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,918
- Hey, nice chopper.
- Thanks.

169
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,960
- Where are you from?
- Dawson City.

170
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:42,724
- Where are you from originally?
- Dawson City.

171
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,780
One of you gentlemen want
to help her with her bags there?

172
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,429
Yeah. Here, let me
take that for you.

173
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,889
No thanks.

174
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,861
- Oh, hey, let me get that.
- Oh, thank you.

175
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,165
Thanks.

176
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,076
- Can I ride in the front?
- Yeah.

177
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:03,554
There you go.
Hop in.

178
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,188
Thanks.

179
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,940
Oh, shoot.

180
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:14,140
Uh, just put your stuff
in the back there, guys.

181
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,151
- Evy.
- Hey, Bart.

182
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:25,323
Well... shoot.

183
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:27,495
You weren't supposed
to come up.

184
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,147
- What?
- That's what he said.

185
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,493
I was supposed to give you some
sort of paperwork when I got back.

186
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:33,970
So he doesn't even
want me to come up there?

187
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,865
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

188
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:42,357
You know what? I don't really
care what he says. I'm coming.

189
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,486
Uh... Uh... Evy?

190
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,658
Listen...

191
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,091
that's going to put me
in a really tight spot, see...

192
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,030
- 'cause...
- Sorry, Bart.

193
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,071
Yeah, you see, I kinda...
I promised him...

194
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,677
Okay.

195
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:14,163
Ground Control, this is Major Tom.
We're outta here, man.

196
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:17,405
This is Ground Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

197
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,494
Did I hear that you're
David Kruipen's daughter?

198
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,623
Yeah.

199
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:46,839
No way. That...
it must be so cool.

200
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,272
Yeah, he's my hero.

201
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,836
Is it true that
when he was younger...

202
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,139
...he sabotaged a pipeline
that was blocking...

203
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,572
- Migratory caribou?
- I guess so, yeah.

204
00:14:56,573 --> 00:15:00,118
Huh, sure has changed.

205
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,673
It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.

206
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,418
I'll wrap him in plastic...

207
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,287
just in case.

208
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,938
Make sure it's sealed.

209
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,023
We need to protect ourselves...

210
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,006
until we're ready.

211
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:00,690
Are you okay?

212
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,731
No.

213
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,337
Ready for what?

214
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,466
Edward, ready for what?

215
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:37,277
Look at that ice.

216
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,466
Yeah, she's breaking up
more and more every year.

217
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,768
It's terrible.
When are we gonna wake up?

218
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:49,660
It's not that easy, buddy, not when
people's lifestyles are at stake.

219
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,979
What are you
implying, Federico?

220
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,717
I'm just saying that we can't ignore
the reality of what we're up against.

221
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,367
Somebody's got
to take responsibility.

222
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:02,496
Okay, sure, but what are we
really doing to stop it?

223
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,191
I mean really stop it?

224
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:08,276
Look at Kruipen. He's attacking
the problem from the inside out...

225
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,404
- Changing how people think.
- What if we don't have that much time?

226
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,445
Maybe the best way to change
how people think is to...

227
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,878
blow something up,
you know?

228
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:20,251
Look at that ice down there.
That's melting fast.

229
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,657
What do you think?

230
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:27,073
Oh... You don't want to know
what I think.

231
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,680
Sure we do.

232
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:35,346
Honestly, I think that people
are incapable of change...

233
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:39,240
and our days are numbered. Might
as well enjoy the place while we can.

234
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:43,280
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

235
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,930
Nobody's willing to make
any sacrifices.

236
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:53,578
Thar she blows.

237
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,531
There's no power.

238
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:33,440
What is that smell?

239
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:36,118
Smells like something
died in here.

240
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:44,956
Mmm, ahem!

241
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,258
Hello!

242
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,474
Dr. Kruipen?
Edward?

243
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,734
Why is there no heat?

244
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:53,907
Yeah, wouldn't the pipes
freeze at night?

245
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,602
They must be
out in the field.

246
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,164
There's no running water either.

247
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,901
The genny must be off.

248
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:05,534
I'm gonna go check it out,
okay? All right.

249
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,548
Hey, where you going?

250
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,790
The restroom.
Is that okay with you?

251
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:21,021
Well, now we know why
one of us got bumped.

252
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:24,611
Yeah, and she doesn't even
sound like she wants to be here.

253
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,590
Shoot.

254
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:05,776
Did you want a water?

255
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:08,541
No thanks.

256
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,669
I'm gonna go look around.

257
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,636
Ling...

258
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,965
...look, I know I can never
expect you to trust me again.

259
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,440
I made a huge mistake.

260
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,524
You are so full of shit.

261
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:38,235
What, a little makeup sex
in the Arctic?

262
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,104
Something to tell
your buddies about?

263
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,929
- You know it's not like that.
- Oh, really?

264
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,447
Well, then...
why tell me this now?

265
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:49,689
I don't know.
You were so angry.

266
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:53,252
And I was scared.

267
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,062
Evelyn?

268
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:14,029
I'm looking for something
that belongs to me.

269
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:18,305
You don't really believe what
you said in the helicopter, do you?

270
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:21,260
What did I say?

271
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:23,432
About just giving up.

272
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,631
Bet your dad
doesn't think that.

273
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,147
You'd probably know what
he thinks better than I do.

274
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,579
My dad's in the oil business.

275
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:43,203
A few years ago,
one of his rigs hit sour gas...

276
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:45,636
and the well blew out.

277
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:48,374
The gas blew downwind
and killed nine people.

278
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,964
I asked him how he could live
with himself and you know what he said?

279
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:56,151
"Plenty more
where they came from".

280
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:58,481
Just part of the risk.

281
00:23:03,322 --> 00:23:07,606
So now you know why
I'm willing to blow shit up.

282
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:11,925
You don't really think that
ecoterrorism is the answer.

283
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:14,342
I don't know.

284
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:20,424
But I want to do what needs to be done,
be there when the ball starts rolling.

285
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:30,027
There's a flashlight in the lab. We'll
need it if the genny doesn't start.

286
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:03,502
Ewww.

287
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:06,239
- Man.
- Ugh.

288
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,786
Oh, that is brutal.

289
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,842
God, it stinks.

290
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,494
What the hell is that?

291
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:19,014
I don't know.

292
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:22,169
Hold on.
Don't get so close.

293
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:27,574
Oh my God!
Oh, shit, are you okay?

294
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:29,469
Yeah, it's okay.

295
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:39,523
Hello?

296
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:42,070
Yeah, we're in here.

297
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:48,518
Oh, Jeez Louise!

298
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,647
Not exactly my choice
of words, but...

299
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:53,167
yeah.

300
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:56,731
Why do they have this
rotting bear in here?

301
00:24:56,732 --> 00:24:59,712
- Oh.
- I don't know, but I need a picture.

302
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:10,878
Ow!
Something just bit me.

303
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:14,225
What?

304
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:18,673
Ow.

305
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:21,628
I think it's just a flea bite.
You're gonna make it.

306
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:24,740
Let's get out of here.
The stink is getting to me.

307
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:31,301
Evelyn, hold up.

308
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:36,445
I heard a gunshot.

309
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,227
What?

310
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:41,181
From out in the field
when I was filling up the genny.

311
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:43,528
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.

312
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:46,440
I just thought
you should know.

313
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:48,569
Okay?

314
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,681
Okay.

315
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:17,187
My name is David Kruipen.

316
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:21,185
"What is sacrifice?"

317
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,953
Base station
to field station, come in.

318
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,384
Base station to field station.

319
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,573
Dad?

320
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:55,164
Dad, are you out there?

321
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:01,898
Evelyn?

322
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,809
Jane, could you please
put my dad on?

323
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:11,110
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

324
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:15,559
I don't want to discuss this with you.
Could you please put my dad on?

325
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,600
Evelyn, are the students
with you?

326
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:22,669
Yes, of course they're here.
Why wouldn't they be?

327
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:30,447
Jane, could you please
put my father on?

328
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:35,026
David!

329
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:38,893
They're here!
The students are here.

330
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:41,500
David, Evelyn's here.

331
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,760
She's on the radio.

332
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:46,845
She's at the base station.

333
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:49,191
What's going on, David?

334
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:52,216
Evelyn, what are you
doing here?

335
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,491
- So now you don't even want to see me?
- I do.

336
00:27:56,492 --> 00:28:00,272
It's just... it's very important
that you stay where you are.

337
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:01,966
Where are you?
Everybody's waiting.

338
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,922
Please do what I'm saying,
just this once.

339
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:09,309
- What's going on?
- Just do what I'm asking this one time.

340
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,742
Okay?

341
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:13,464
Please?

342
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:18,200
Okay. Fine.

343
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,085
Good.

344
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:23,762
Why are they here?

345
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:27,978
- I don't know.
- What did you do?

346
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,383
You should lay down.

347
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,973
I'll be there in a minute.

348
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:52,093
The students are here.
Evelyn too.

349
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:55,543
What did you tell Jane?

350
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:58,367
Nothing.
I don't think she's...

351
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:00,740
got the strength
to go through with it.

352
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,318
- I'll take care of it.
- I know.

353
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,430
- We're doing the right thing.
- I know.

354
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,726
Jane?

355
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:34,197
Edward, no!

356
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,118
Any luck?

357
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,507
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, they're on their way.

358
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:56,531
Good.

359
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,616
Everything okay?

360
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:06,570
I don't know. Why did he
tell you not to bring me?

361
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,654
- He didn't say.
- God, he's such an asshole.

362
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,881
It tears him up, Evy.
It really does.

363
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,907
Look, I know you're probably
still mad about the funeral.

364
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:28,008
But he did everything
he could to get there.

365
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:32,771
- I mean, we were snowed in.
- Yeah, I know.

366
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,717
You hear that?

367
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:20,525
Yeah, what is that?

368
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:32,100
It sounds like...

369
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:35,733
homo sapiens mating.

370
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:04,297
I missed you so much.

371
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,427
I know you did.

372
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:08,164
A bug!

373
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:10,164
- Jesus.
- What?

374
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:13,276
It's a bug.

375
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:17,550
- It's just a bug.
- You don't understand.

376
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:20,462
It's something I've had since
I was a kid. It's a phobia, okay?

377
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,504
It's... it's a...

378
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:25,659
I can't handle it.

379
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,153
You never told me that.

380
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,585
It's not exactly
something I'm proud of.

381
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,279
All right?
Now come on, let's go.

382
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,261
Where are you going?
I'm not going to go sleep out there.

383
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,319
Okay, come on, you don't understand.
I can't stay here.

384
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,708
- Please come with me.
- It's okay, Feddy.

385
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:46,446
- I'll look after you.
- I can't stay here.

386
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:49,732
Okay? I'll be
in the other room.

387
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:42,760
What are you doing?

388
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:45,237
Somebody's here.

389
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,913
Bart!

390
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,231
- You guys!
- God.

391
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,664
I feel like ass.

392
00:33:56,665 --> 00:33:59,038
Dude, your arm is bleeding.

393
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:06,919
Jeez Louise,
this ain't no flea bite.

394
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,830
- Ow!
- Stop scratching it.

395
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,002
It's flipping itchy, man.

396
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:15,723
Hello?

397
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:22,805
Dad?

398
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:31,713
Hello?

399
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,346
Jane? Oh my God.

400
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,778
Help!
Somebody help!

401
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:12,905
What was that?

402
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,990
What's going on?

403
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:22,770
Ling?

404
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:29,000
No no, Ling...

405
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,111
Ling, honey, it's okay.

406
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:38,168
Ling, you'll be fine, baby.

407
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,339
- Who the hell is this?
- My dad's assistant.

408
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,687
Evelyn found her
in the helicopter.

409
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:46,711
Jesus Christ.

410
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,545
I... I thought
there was a bug.

411
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:02,762
- Uh-huh.
- It was just my zipper.

412
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:05,004
Yeah.

413
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,219
- I'm gonna try my dad again.
- Okay.

414
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:12,625
Oh, uh...

415
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:15,259
sorry.

416
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:20,083
Base station
to field station, come in.

417
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:24,297
Base station to
field station, come in.

418
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:28,294
Dad, it's me.
Come in.

419
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,640
Dad, are you there?

420
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:03,594
Ahem.
Is she contagious?

421
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:05,810
I don't know.

422
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:07,679
She's burning up.
Might be pneumonia.

423
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,069
We gotta get her out of here.
She needs medical attention.

424
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,155
That's the best idea
I've heard in a long time.

425
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:15,066
This place is infested with bugs.
Ling's got bites all over her face.

426
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:19,611
We gotta get out of here.
I got this... it's a medical condition.

427
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:24,885
It's a phobia.
It's like a panic attack!

428
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:26,320
All right, all right.

429
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:29,709
As soon as light breaks,
we'll fly out to Sachs Harbour.

430
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,620
What about my dad?
Nobody's answering at the field station.

431
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,576
Something's obviously
happened out there... something bad.

432
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:38,340
We don't even know where
"out there" is, do we?

433
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:45,943
What?

434
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,045
Look, the ATV she came
in on has a GPS unit.

435
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,869
We'll get the coordinates for
the field station. We'll fly out there...

436
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,259
and we'll see what's going on.

437
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,432
If there's an emergency,
we'll call for a second chopper.

438
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:59,387
Okay, sounds reasonable.

439
00:37:59,388 --> 00:38:01,429
Guys, I'm sorry.

440
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,384
It's all right. Let's load everything
into the helicopter.

441
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:06,123
We'll come back
and we'll get Jane.

442
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:08,192
- Thank you.
- Okay.

443
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:12,318
Where did you get
my dad's camera?

444
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,402
It was in Jane's jacket.

445
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:21,226
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,005
There's no tape.

447
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:33,827
Okay, guys, come on,
let's get packing. Let's go.

448
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:38,493
Are you okay?

449
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:40,823
Yeah.

450
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:57,439
- What time is it?
- About 3:00 a. M.

451
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,116
Jesus.

452
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:12,777
Holy shit.

453
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:15,715
What is it?

454
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:19,670
Oh, man.

455
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,901
- What?
- Take a look.

456
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:27,273
Jesus H Christ.

457
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,026
- What the heck was she thinking?
- That's a really good question.

458
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:34,764
What?

459
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:37,024
- Sabotage.
- Jane.

460
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,065
It'll take me a couple
hours to fix this.

461
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:43,351
You gotta be kidding me?
Can't we call another helicopter?

462
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,236
It won't take me that long.

463
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:48,668
Oh, whoa whoa.
What's that for?

464
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:50,537
Relax, it's just a precaution.

465
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,275
- I have to go.
- Evy!

466
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:54,404
- Where are you going?
- The field station.

467
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,185
I don't think
that's a good idea.

468
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,879
No kidding. What if this thing's
fixed and you're not back?

469
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,182
- Evy.
- Honestly, what do we do?

470
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:05,250
Hey, that woman's really sick.
I don't think she can breathe.

471
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:11,029
Come on.

472
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:15,478
Oh my God,
oh my God.

473
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,738
Oh, Jane!

474
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,127
Jane, it's me. It's Evelyn.

475
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,866
Oh no.

476
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:24,646
We have to do something.
It's okay.

477
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:27,080
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

478
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:30,453
Sorry for what?
It's okay.

479
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,032
- Don't let them leave.
- Let who leave?

480
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,030
No.

481
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:40,724
Holy shit.

482
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:43,418
- She can't breathe!
- What can I do? Tell me what to do!

483
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:46,763
No, stay with me, please.
Please!

484
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:50,092
Jane, stay with me.
It's okay.

485
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:55,019
No no.

486
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,087
- No!
- No no no no! I wouldn't do that, no.

487
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:16,772
Better seal off the room.
Who knows what she's got?

488
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:19,901
Yeah, it's a good call.

489
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,088
There... there's some plastic...

490
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,174
around back by the genny.

491
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:30,634
Yeah.

492
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:37,151
Come on, everybody out.

493
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,512
Now.

494
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,973
Just give me a minute.
I knew her!

495
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,183
Evy.

496
00:41:58,678 --> 00:42:00,746
Oh, God damn it.

497
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:19,055
Hey, where the hell is she going?
I thought we agreed to stick together?

498
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,473
Atom!

499
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:25,991
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

500
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:29,658
That woman just died in there, man.
Think about it.

501
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:32,552
That's her dad out there, man.

502
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:42,546
As soon as that helicopter gets fixed,
we're getting out of here.

503
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:47,718
Get the duct tape.
Let's seal up this door.

504
00:42:54,035 --> 00:42:56,337
Evelyn!

505
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:59,840
- Wait for me.
- What are you doing?

506
00:43:02,899 --> 00:43:05,836
I'm coming with you.

507
00:44:14,378 --> 00:44:16,836
Why'd you stop?

508
00:44:37,495 --> 00:44:39,607
Shoot.

509
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:46,471
Shoot.

510
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:55,787
- How is it going?
- It's worse than I thought.

511
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:59,133
Why didn't you say something?
We should be calling for help.

512
00:44:59,134 --> 00:45:02,636
- I'm doing everything I can, okay?
- This is so fucked.

513
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,801
Dad?

514
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:22,840
Dad?

515
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:28,272
Holy crap.

516
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:35,110
Is that a wooly mammoth?

517
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:37,483
Jesus, it's pristine.

518
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:43,019
What is it?

519
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,957
It looks like eggs of some kind.

520
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:50,606
Yeah, it looks like they're
thawing with the mammoth.

521
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,926
Oh my God,
did you see that?

522
00:45:53,927 --> 00:45:56,777
That's impossible.

523
00:45:59,227 --> 00:46:01,616
Isn't there that
species of frog?

524
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:03,745
Yeah, the-the... Um...

525
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:06,569
the wood frog... its liver glycogen
converts to glucose...

526
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:08,785
but, you know,
that happens over a winter.

527
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,306
This thing's gotta be what?
20,000 years old?

528
00:46:11,307 --> 00:46:13,809
Yeah.

529
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:20,893
Dad?

530
00:46:23,257 --> 00:46:26,297
Oh... oh my God.

531
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:28,687
- Who is that?
- It's Edward.

532
00:46:28,688 --> 00:46:31,641
He works for my dad.

533
00:46:31,643 --> 00:46:33,971
Dad!

534
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:54,019
No no no.

535
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,653
- No no no...
- Evelyn.

536
00:46:57,888 --> 00:46:59,538
No, God, no!

537
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:01,536
- Don't don't, Evelyn!
- No, please.

538
00:47:01,537 --> 00:47:03,926
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to see him like this.

539
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:06,360
- No no!
- Don't remember him like this.

540
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:11,600
It's okay.

541
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:15,729
What am I supposed
to do now?

542
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,134
It's not fair!

543
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:21,898
He's gone and I still hate him.

544
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,543
Ow, ohh.

545
00:47:37,516 --> 00:47:41,366
Oh, Jesus Christ.

546
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,413
I just had the most
painful piss of my life.

547
00:48:01,414 --> 00:48:04,586
- Any idea why?
- What are you saying?

548
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:07,584
- Oh, little Miss Innocent?
- Oh God.

549
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:10,607
Who have you been seeing
for the past couple months?

550
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:20,863
Jesus, baby, I'm sorry.

551
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:25,686
I just...

552
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:30,004
Oh, I guess I'm just...

553
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,986
I'm scared, okay?

554
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:40,346
There's something
wrong with us.

555
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:43,979
Some kind of infection.

556
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:53,930
It's inside of me
down there.

557
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:17,280
What happened?

558
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:19,931
They're all dead.

559
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:22,869
Shot.

560
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:25,797
Jane shot them all.

561
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:27,953
Kruipen too?

562
00:49:29,274 --> 00:49:32,254
Why would she do that?

563
00:49:33,662 --> 00:49:35,556
I don't know.

564
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:45,003
Look, man, I don't know
what a "20" is...

565
00:49:45,004 --> 00:49:47,306
I just know that we're
in trouble and we need help now.

566
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:49,218
I just need to know
where you are.

567
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,739
What are your coordinates?

568
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,388
I don't know where I am, man.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

569
00:49:54,389 --> 00:49:58,586
- David Kruipen's research center.
- Okay, stand by.

570
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:32,174
Ling, are you all right?

571
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:36,259
Get out. Get out!

572
00:50:44,446 --> 00:50:47,095
- Evy, what are you doing?
- I need to see her.

573
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:49,919
- This room is quarantined, Evelyn.
- Please!

574
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,309
Please, you have to trust me.
We need to see her, please.

575
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,786
Please trust me.

576
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:59,376
Please.

577
00:51:22,553 --> 00:51:24,638
Oh God.

578
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,855
What is it?

579
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:30,244
- Eggs.
- What do you mean eggs?

580
00:51:30,245 --> 00:51:33,719
Like the ones
from the mammoth?

581
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,832
What?

582
00:51:45,192 --> 00:51:47,407
- Oh my God, did you see that?
- What?

583
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:50,014
- What happened?
- The bugs that bit Ling...

584
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:53,360
they must be some kind of parasite.
I just saw one. They're inside of Jane.

585
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,880
- We gotta move her.
- We have to get her to the lab.

586
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:57,662
It's a separate structure.

587
00:51:57,663 --> 00:52:00,904
Come on, use the sheet
to wrap her up.

588
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,211
What is it, Evy?

589
00:52:24,212 --> 00:52:26,280
The bear's infected too.

590
00:52:32,685 --> 00:52:34,883
There's more eggs over here.

591
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:39,098
I wonder how long they stay
in their larval state.

592
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:45,398
I radioed for a rescue helicopter.
We're getting out of here.

593
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:48,370
- How long?
- A few hours if the weather holds.

594
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,178
Oh, thank God.

595
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:54,828
What, Evy?

596
00:52:57,278 --> 00:53:01,014
We have to call them back
and tell them not to come.

597
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:03,230
- Excuse me?
- They won't be prepared.

598
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:07,184
We have to contact disease control.
They'll have time to study this thing...

599
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,226
- And decide what to do.
- What?

600
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,834
- Evelyn, we have to get out of here.
- We have to be quarantined.

601
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:13,702
Quarantined?
Are you out of your mind?

602
00:53:13,703 --> 00:53:16,528
Ling is sick in there. She's been
throwing up. We have to get out of here.

603
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:19,308
- Federico, you don't understand.
- Hold on, hold on.

604
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:22,089
Maybe we're jumping
to conclusions.

605
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,826
I mean, we're just
students here.

606
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,955
She's not even a student.

607
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:30,240
They died out there
because they couldn't stop it!

608
00:53:30,997 --> 00:53:32,821
They're dead?

609
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:35,211
Jane was trying to stop us
from getting home.

610
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,340
She said don't let them leave...
she was talking about the bugs.

611
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,991
What do you mean?
What bugs?

612
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:41,686
Look, you don't know that.

613
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:43,814
We don't know what
happened out there.

614
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:46,204
- You saw the eggs in the mammoth, Atom.
- Mammoth?

615
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:48,986
Jesus Christ, would somebody please
tell me what's going on here?

616
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:52,505
There's a wooly mammoth
in a glacier melting out there.

617
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:55,894
It's full of eggs.
The same ones that are in this bear...

618
00:53:55,895 --> 00:54:00,049
the same ones that are in Jane, and very
likely, the same ones that are in Ling.

619
00:54:01,457 --> 00:54:05,089
And me.

620
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:09,956
And Ling?

621
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:13,492
Fed...

622
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:16,403
we think that the insects
that bit Ling...

623
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:20,835
- They're laying eggs inside.
- What?

624
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:23,138
They're some sort
of prehistoric parasite...

625
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:25,398
that thawed in the ice
inside the mammoth.

626
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:28,222
This is so sick.

627
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,481
You guys are sick. Where would you
come up with something like this?

628
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:34,610
We have to contact disease control.
They'll know what to do better than us.

629
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:37,244
No no.

630
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:41,475
No no... Hey!
Where are you going?

631
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:44,152
Hey hey!

632
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,194
We could die here.

633
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:53,103
Hey, stay away
from the radio!

634
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:55,884
Don't. Don't!

635
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:04,011
- Put the gun down!
- I didn't have a choice.

636
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:12,569
I'm in charge now. Until the helicopter
arrives, I'm in charge!

637
00:55:14,108 --> 00:55:16,394
What was that noise?

638
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:24,406
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a scratch.

639
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:27,474
Oh, Jesus.

640
00:55:28,362 --> 00:55:31,559
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

641
00:55:33,054 --> 00:55:35,295
Soon, baby, soon.

642
00:55:39,094 --> 00:55:41,813
Jesus.

643
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:45,046
It's the same color as...

644
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:49,043
- As what?
- Maybe you'd be comfortable lying down.

645
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:51,824
- That's a good idea.
- Same color as what?

646
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:54,892
All right, put her
in the spare bedroom.

647
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:59,038
It's okay, baby.

648
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,539
You'll be fine.
You just need to lie down for a minute.

649
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:13,794
- Where's Feddy?
- I'm right here, babe.

650
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:19,156
- When are we going home?
- Soon.

651
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:21,615
Really soon.
It won't be long now.

652
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:29,089
Wait.

653
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,769
We need to seal off the room.

654
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,897
- What about me?
- Good question.

655
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,764
You guys need to see this.

656
00:57:18,511 --> 00:57:20,769
What is that?

657
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,403
What do you think it is?

658
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,359
Oh my God.

659
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,223
Ohh.

660
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:46,363
Do you think they can get out?

661
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:49,144
No. But we need
to seal that door.

662
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:51,604
Okay.

663
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:58,426
I need to do
something about this.

664
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,163
Right now.

665
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:14,172
Bart, wait.
What are you going to do?

666
00:58:14,173 --> 00:58:18,197
I doubt there's a chopper between
here and Dawson City this time of year.

667
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,037
They're not gonna
be here for a while...

668
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:25,019
and I ain't got that kind of time.

669
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:30,294
If these things hatch,
they'll spread.

670
00:58:30,295 --> 00:58:33,970
If that happens, I'm done.

671
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,158
If I can just kind
of get underneath...

672
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:40,443
some of them.

673
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:50,134
If I can just...

674
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:55,348
It's starting to come off a little bit.

675
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:06,819
- Oh shit.
- Oh, Jesus!

676
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:26,113
No.

677
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,476
No no no,
don't look at me.

678
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:30,892
Bart, no, you'll lose
too much blood.

679
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:35,063
Okay, then...

680
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:38,469
we'll burn them out then.
I don't see why not.

681
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,381
We'll just douse
the arm in gasoline.

682
00:59:40,382 --> 00:59:44,231
How do you know if you'll get them all?
You'll have to burn it to the bone.

683
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,461
If you don't do it...

684
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:54,981
I will.

685
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:57,832
We have to be
more prepared.

686
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:17,315
Are you sure about this?
I don't even know if this is morphine.

687
01:00:17,316 --> 01:00:20,401
The worst that can
happen is that I OD.

688
01:00:20,402 --> 01:00:23,773
There are worse ways to go.

689
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:31,073
Go on, man, jab it in.

690
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,631
Jeez Louise.

691
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:56,074
There we go.

692
01:00:56,075 --> 01:00:58,839
Oooh, a guy could
get used to that.

693
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:14,612
All right, man, do it.

694
01:01:24,362 --> 01:01:26,404
Something's happening
in there.

695
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:29,472
They're hatching.

696
01:01:31,706 --> 01:01:34,443
Okay.
Okay, here we go.

697
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:37,337
Atom, hurry!

698
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:48,938
This isn't right.
You can't just chop off body parts.

699
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:54,691
This isn't the way.

700
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:56,038
- Atom.
- Do it.

701
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:57,803
Atom!

702
01:02:00,993 --> 01:02:02,904
- Atom, do it again!
- Oooh.

703
01:02:02,905 --> 01:02:06,189
Atom!

704
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:21,050
- Evelyn.
- Oh my God.

705
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,657
Bart.

706
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:29,089
Get the bugs.

707
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:33,476
- With what?
- Try the bug spray.

708
01:02:38,752 --> 01:02:42,184
- It's not working.
- There's a lighter... try it.

709
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:45,600
God, I can't stop it.

710
01:02:52,918 --> 01:02:55,741
It's working.
It's working.

711
01:02:55,742 --> 01:02:58,782
I need something else to stop
the bleeding. This is not working.

712
01:02:58,784 --> 01:03:01,937
I saw in the...
ATV kit.

713
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,375
Is he okay?

714
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:29,850
- The bleeding's starting to slow.
- Aw, he could go into shock.

715
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,024
Get his arm up.
Get his arm up.

716
01:03:32,025 --> 01:03:34,587
We gotta put him on the couch.
Lie him on his back.

717
01:03:34,588 --> 01:03:36,195
Okay?
Okay?

718
01:03:36,196 --> 01:03:38,889
Come on, come on.
There we go.

719
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,322
- Get some gauze and some tape.
- Okay.

720
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:46,406
Lie him on his back. Okay, wait...
put his feet up, okay?

721
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,970
- Put his feet up.
- Oh, fuck.

722
01:03:48,971 --> 01:03:50,881
There we go.
There we go, buddy.

723
01:03:50,882 --> 01:03:53,863
Got the tape.
We need some gauze.

724
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:57,252
Shit.

725
01:03:59,399 --> 01:04:02,554
What the hell?

726
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:06,594
Shit.

727
01:04:15,868 --> 01:04:18,647
It looks like they knew
what they were dealing with.

728
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:20,629
Who?

729
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:24,670
Dr. Kruipen.

730
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:30,075
It's a vertebrate.
It's not a bug.

731
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:32,509
- So we're related to this thing?
- Yeah.

732
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,898
It says that the males are harmless,
except for they create the sores...

733
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:38,940
that the females bore into
and then they lay their eggs...

734
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,982
and multiply.

735
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:43,023
What are you saying?
If you're bit by a male...

736
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:44,979
you might not necessarily
be infected?

737
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,455
Yeah, the eggs
are the only threat.

738
01:04:47,456 --> 01:04:51,366
These tapes, they only
date up to yesterday.

739
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:53,452
We have to see what's on them.
We need to know...

740
01:04:53,453 --> 01:04:55,321
exactly what we're
dealing with right now.

741
01:04:55,322 --> 01:04:58,389
This tape's the most recent.
Where's my dad's camera?

742
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:03,082
It's with Jane's jacket.
But we put all that stuff in the lab.

743
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,136
- What the hell are you doing?
- We have to get in there.

744
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:15,830
You're not going back in there.
It's completely sealed.

745
01:05:15,831 --> 01:05:17,742
You're just going to bring
those bugs back in here with you.

746
01:05:17,743 --> 01:05:20,436
We need to get the information
before the helicopter gets here.

747
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:24,200
There might be something
in there that can help Ling.

748
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:28,475
Maybe save us all.

749
01:05:28,476 --> 01:05:32,586
You get any bugs on you,
you're not coming back in here.

750
01:06:39,607 --> 01:06:42,038
Evelyn!
Behind you!

751
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,890
Shit.

752
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:49,947
There's no fucking way she's getting
in here. She's covered in bugs.

753
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:52,885
- Back off!
- Let me out! Let me out!

754
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,100
No no!

755
01:06:57,335 --> 01:07:00,011
There's... There's...
there's bugs on her!

756
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:05,285
Atom, step away from her.

757
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:07,198
Atom, step away.

758
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,935
There's one under my shirt!

759
01:07:09,936 --> 01:07:12,656
God!

760
01:07:13,282 --> 01:07:15,089
What the fuck is that?

761
01:07:15,933 --> 01:07:17,757
Get it out.

762
01:07:17,758 --> 01:07:19,477
Get it!

763
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:25,969
- It's fine.
- What if it laid eggs in her? Huh?

764
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:28,055
I got it. She's fine.

765
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:30,401
All right. Um...

766
01:07:30,402 --> 01:07:32,296
...the rest now.

767
01:07:33,747 --> 01:07:35,137
She's clean, Fed.
Drop it.

768
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,076
Take the rest
of your clothes off.

769
01:07:38,049 --> 01:07:40,091
- Now.
- It's okay.

770
01:07:40,092 --> 01:07:42,481
He's right.

771
01:07:42,482 --> 01:07:45,201
Atom, I need you
to check me.

772
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:26,497
She's clean.

773
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:28,914
Okay.

774
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:39,733
I had to be sure.

775
01:09:16,772 --> 01:09:20,361
Are you sure you
want to see this?

776
01:09:21,682 --> 01:09:24,099
Of course.

777
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,226
I'm really sorry,
you know?

778
01:09:29,808 --> 01:09:33,266
Whatever happened between you
and your dad, I know it must be hard.

779
01:09:34,805 --> 01:09:38,149
The weather's cleaning up.
They should be here soon.

780
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,539
What exactly are you guys
trying to find on that tape?

781
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,321
I mean, they're bugs and they
eat people... it's that simple.

782
01:09:43,322 --> 01:09:46,145
We need to know what's gonna
happen if the bugs get off the island.

783
01:09:46,146 --> 01:09:47,796
What kind of habitat
can they survive in?

784
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,752
What are the odds
of this turning into a pandemic?

785
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:51,402
My dad would have
thought this through.

786
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:53,341
We have to get that
information back.

787
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:59,180
"Today I rediscovered...

788
01:09:59,181 --> 01:10:02,813
what I knew when
I was young.

789
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,176
Whoa!
One got out.

790
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:09,201
Somebody kill it.

791
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:01,213
Oh my God.

792
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,219
It's time to get out of here.

793
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,826
We have to get
to the helicopter.

794
01:11:20,827 --> 01:11:23,721
It's the only safe place.
Everything else should be burned.

795
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,562
- Help me! Help me!
- Oh my God.

796
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:29,761
Shit, they're coming
through the vents.

797
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,124
- We've got to get her out of there.
- No, we can't.

798
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:35,818
- There's too many. It's too dangerous.
- We gotta do something.

799
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:40,320
- What's going on?
- The vertebrates... they're with Ling.

800
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,533
We gotta sedate her.
Get me some drugs, man.

801
01:11:46,855 --> 01:11:48,852
Get me something to wear...
something protective.

802
01:11:48,854 --> 01:11:50,808
Jeez, you almost fell.

803
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:53,834
You gotta loosen this.
It's too tight.

804
01:11:55,807 --> 01:11:58,960
I can't.

805
01:12:01,586 --> 01:12:03,236
Feddy!

806
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:05,973
Feddy, open this door, Feddy.

807
01:12:05,974 --> 01:12:08,433
- Almost got it.
- Agh.

808
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:12,143
Help me, Feddy.

809
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:15,385
Oh, please,
you have them too.

810
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,639
Feddy, what are you doing?

811
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:35,894
She was suffering.
She asked me to.

812
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,729
She's still alive.

813
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:53,623
You son of a bitch.

814
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:06,050
I gotta sedate her.

815
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:20,303
Bart, wait.

816
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:23,752
It's okay, Evy.

817
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:27,297
- I got nothing to lose.
- No.

818
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:39,291
Evelyn, come on.
Come on, we've gotta go.

819
01:14:19,023 --> 01:14:22,526
We need to make sure
everyone's clean before we leave.

820
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:28,305
I'm going straight
to the helicopter.

821
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:37,907
Anybody who wants to leave
can come with me.

822
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:42,471
It's just a precaution.
We're not accusing you of anything.

823
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:45,815
We just want to be sure.

824
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,248
Fuck that.

825
01:14:51,351 --> 01:14:54,393
Federico, wait!

826
01:14:54,394 --> 01:14:58,026
You can't go in there.
I know why you shot Ling.

827
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:03,197
You're gonna fuck
this up, aren't you?

828
01:15:05,605 --> 01:15:09,427
- Fed...
- Shut the fuck up, Atom.

829
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:12,642
Soon as the helicopter gets here,
she's gonna blow the whistle on me.

830
01:15:12,643 --> 01:15:16,754
And that means I'm gonna
die with these fucking bugs in my dick.

831
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,028
I can't let that happen.

832
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:23,880
Please don't.

833
01:15:24,723 --> 01:15:26,791
I'm sorry.

834
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,326
Dad?

835
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:35,656
- Dad!
- Kruipen.

836
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,669
Oh my God,
you're alive!

837
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,450
I'm sorry.

838
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:44,840
Me too.

839
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:47,013
I'm so sorry.

840
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:49,907
- Are you infected?
- No.

841
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:54,922
- You're shot.
- I'm okay.

842
01:15:54,923 --> 01:15:58,224
Jane...

843
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,353
Jane died.

844
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:02,438
She sabotaged
the helicopter.

845
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:05,219
It's okay though.
We already called for help.

846
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:08,999
The whole place...
it's almost entirely infested.

847
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,693
Now the only safe place
is the helicopter.

848
01:16:11,694 --> 01:16:14,067
We're gonna burn it down.

849
01:16:15,953 --> 01:16:18,603
There's some gasoline
around the back.

850
01:16:18,604 --> 01:16:21,558
- You should wait in the helicopter.
- I'll be okay. Go on.

851
01:16:21,559 --> 01:16:24,496
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

852
01:16:53,453 --> 01:16:56,562
Bet you wish you didn't
get on that helicopter now, huh?

853
01:17:00,622 --> 01:17:05,096
What?

854
01:17:05,097 --> 01:17:08,121
He knew.

855
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:19,957
"These parasites were
discovered in a thawing glacier.

856
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,390
They are just one...

857
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:26,197
of the horrors that will
come from global warming.

858
01:17:27,127 --> 01:17:28,994
And so today I...

859
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:31,862
prepare this statement...

860
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:34,643
as I prepare myself...

861
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:38,728
for the ultimate sacrifice,
the only sacrifice.

862
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:41,943
Though thousands will die...

863
01:17:41,944 --> 01:17:44,247
the threat will surely
be contained.

864
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:48,373
This video, too,
will surely be contained.

865
01:17:48,374 --> 01:17:52,328
But the impact of both...

866
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:54,675
will survive...

867
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:56,847
spread through the veins
of the internet...

868
01:17:56,848 --> 01:17:58,846
onto the screens
of the youth...

869
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:01,366
...into your souls...

870
01:18:01,367 --> 01:18:03,452
...into your spirit.

871
01:18:03,453 --> 01:18:05,756
You will know the need
to sacrifice.

872
01:18:05,757 --> 01:18:08,346
You will know
the time is now.

873
01:18:38,779 --> 01:18:42,194
You were right, Evy.
No one cares.

874
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:45,557
May I have the tape, please?

875
01:18:45,558 --> 01:18:48,598
Dad, please. Please don't do this.
There has to be another way.

876
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:51,553
Please.
People listen to you.

877
01:18:51,554 --> 01:18:54,725
- You didn't.
- I only said that to hurt you.

878
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:57,246
You were right.
You've always been right.

879
01:18:57,247 --> 01:19:01,201
We can change people's minds, but, Dad,
this is not the way to do it, please.

880
01:19:01,202 --> 01:19:03,069
I'm getting on the helicopter.

881
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,067
Alone.

882
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:07,761
When the fear...
when it spreads...

883
01:19:07,762 --> 01:19:09,281
...the people will know.

884
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:12,584
- You can't go.
- Maybe he's right.

885
01:19:12,585 --> 01:19:14,496
How could he
possibly be right?

886
01:19:14,497 --> 01:19:18,667
Dad, you were going to save me.
What about everybody else?

887
01:19:18,668 --> 01:19:21,361
What about
other people's children?

888
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:24,186
How do you know how quickly
they'll be able to isolate it?

889
01:19:24,187 --> 01:19:27,098
How many people
are going to die? Thousands.

890
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:31,424
Maybe hundreds of thousands.
Plenty more where they came from, right?

891
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:35,031
Please. Please don't.

892
01:19:37,743 --> 01:19:41,985
I'm sorry.

893
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:49,040
Dad!

894
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:51,283
No!

895
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:56,107
- No.
- The window... gotta go to the window.

896
01:19:57,557 --> 01:20:00,277
Oh my God.

897
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:10,706
That's Dr. Kruipen.
He looks hurt.

898
01:20:18,024 --> 01:20:20,065
Are you okay?

899
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:23,741
- I should take a look at that.
- No, let's go.

900
01:20:30,147 --> 01:20:32,536
Hey, is there
somebody else in there?

901
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:35,229
Quarantine.
They're contaminated.

902
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,793
- Are you contaminated?
- No. Let's go.

903
01:20:38,794 --> 01:20:41,052
Aw, shit!

904
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:44,181
Stop, he's infected!

905
01:20:44,182 --> 01:20:47,423
Stop, this whole area's
quarantined!

906
01:20:50,004 --> 01:20:54,522
- He's on the skid.
- If he gets in, we die.

907
01:20:54,523 --> 01:20:57,346
- He's infected.
- What did he say?

908
01:20:57,347 --> 01:20:58,954
This whole area's quarantined.

909
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:02,083
Something about the quarantine.
We've got to put him down.

910
01:21:02,084 --> 01:21:04,864
We can't.

911
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:07,080
He's infected.

912
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:09,496
He's rocking us.
I can't stabilize it.

913
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:20,663
- Jesus Christ. Is he okay?
- He's not moving.

914
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:27,589
- We need to go now.
- What about her?

915
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,849
- She'll be okay.
- No.

916
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,613
No.

917
01:21:40,018 --> 01:21:42,189
Hey, she's got a gun!

918
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,666
Get up, get up!

919
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,865
Aw, fuck!

920
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,297
Fuck!

921
01:21:53,531 --> 01:21:56,034
Come on!

922
01:22:25,469 --> 01:22:28,162
Oh my God, no, we need
to get you to the helicopter.

923
01:22:28,163 --> 01:22:30,986
No, it's too late.

924
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,924
- No.
- It's too late.

925
01:22:34,854 --> 01:22:38,590
You have to... you have to get your
father's notes. You have to warn them.

926
01:22:38,591 --> 01:22:40,676
I can't.

927
01:22:40,677 --> 01:22:43,369
No, I can't leave you here.
I can't do this.

928
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:45,803
Yes, you can, Evy.

929
01:22:45,804 --> 01:22:48,828
This is it.

930
01:22:50,974 --> 01:22:53,912
The ball's rolling.

931
01:22:57,623 --> 01:23:01,298
This is the beginning.

932
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,251
No. No.

933
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:02,850
What is sacrifice?

934
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:05,023
We keep saying
we want change...

935
01:25:05,024 --> 01:25:08,326
...but we just keep doing the same
shitty things every day.

936
01:25:08,327 --> 01:25:11,931
And that's no justification
for what my father did.

937
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:14,929
Or what he tried to do.

938
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:17,711
A body! There's a body
over here!

939
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,796
But I want people to know that he
really did believe he was helping us...

940
01:25:20,797 --> 01:25:24,663
...and he sacrificed everything...
including himself.

941
01:25:24,664 --> 01:25:27,227
I have a pulse!

942
01:25:27,228 --> 01:25:29,834
Come on, let's get
her out of there!

943
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:32,615
I used to believe that
people couldn't change...

944
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:35,048
...that all we could do was just...

945
01:25:35,049 --> 01:25:38,073
...have as much fun as we could
before it all came to an end.

946
01:25:39,784 --> 01:25:42,173
But now...

947
01:25:42,174 --> 01:25:44,677
...now I don't want it to end.

948
01:26:09,288 --> 01:26:11,721
All right, we're back and today...

949
01:26:11,722 --> 01:26:13,894
...we're talking
about Evelyn Kruipen...

950
01:26:13,895 --> 01:26:17,066
...daughter of infamous ecologist,
Dr. David Kruipen.

951
01:26:17,067 --> 01:26:19,065
- Max!
- Now she's being hailed as a hero.

952
01:26:19,066 --> 01:26:21,890
- Max, come on.
- She's on the front of every newspaper...

953
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:24,496
- And website around the globe.
- Come on, boy, let's go.

954
01:26:24,497 --> 01:26:27,234
The Center for Disease Control
said this young woman...

955
01:26:27,235 --> 01:26:29,319
...saved us from total annihilation.

956
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,231
Well, I don't know, Mike.

957
01:26:31,232 --> 01:26:34,082
You're a bit of a conspiracy nut.
What do you think?

958
01:26:43,052 --> 01:26:45,049
Well, callers, what do you think?

959
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:47,700
What is going to end
the human race?

960
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:50,046
A giant meteor out of the sky?

961
01:26:50,048 --> 01:26:52,132
Are we all going
to starve to death?

962
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:55,694
Or is a tiny little bug going
to come and wipe us all out?

963
01:26:55,695 --> 01:26:57,780
First caller, you're on the air.

964
01:26:57,781 --> 01:27:00,822
I honestly think it's just more
global warming propaganda.

965
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:02,995
I... I think the whole thing's
just a marketing scam.

966
01:27:02,996 --> 01:27:04,863
It's just another example...

967
01:27:04,864 --> 01:27:06,297
...of how vulnerable
we are, you know?

968
01:27:06,298 --> 01:27:08,209
You've got SARS, bird flu, AIDS.

969
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:11,234
It's just a matter of time
before the big one hits.
